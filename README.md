A repo to hold my Ludum Dare 25 Entry. This should be a smaller project than the one I submitted for LD23, but we'll see how it goes!

Lunar Frenzy
===
"After years of living under the shadow of puny planets, an oversized moon goes rogue, in a revenge-fueled trip across the universe with one goal only: smash all those planets into tiny little pieces. Will it succeed? Or will it fall to the many space-mines that litter the galaxy?"

The game was made with touch controls in mind, so I strongly suggest you play the Android version if you have the chance. All comments are extremely appreciated! And don't forget to post your highscore! 

Play the game here [FLASH](http://fireblend.github.com/LD25/index.html) or [ANDROID](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g5lc5zibjtvuyfs/Fireblend%20-%20Lunar%20Frenzy.apk)

About Ludum Dare

About the Ludum Dare (from Wikipedia):

Ludum Dare (from Latin "to give a game") is also known as LD48, and is an accelerated game development competition. It was founded by Geoff Howland and was first held in April 2002. Participants are given 48 hours to create a game from scratch fitting a theme announced at the start of the contest. All of the code and content must be created during the 48 hours, each entry must be created by a single person and source code must be shown. After the competition ends, participants are given 3 weeks to play and rate games created by their peers. There are no physical or cash prizes but participants retain full ownership of their entries.

This is the second time I participate on a Ludum Dare.
